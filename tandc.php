This site is designed to be a useful supplement to your monitoring, not as a complete alternative.
If we turn this site off and you are utterly devastated, then you were relying on it too much. It would be OK
to be mildly irritated or in fact somewhat peeved, we have no intention of turning it off so don't worry too much.
